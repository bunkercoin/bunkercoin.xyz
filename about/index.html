        <h1>About Bunkercoin</h1>
        <p>
            Bunkercoin, a new, stupid cryptocurrency! Made as a joke and for fun. It is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Bunkercoin currently employs a simplified
            variant of the Scrypt algorithm. The block time is currently set to 60 seconds (1 minute if you can't count) and the difficulty retarget is calculated by DigiShield. You can find more info about it at the <a href="https://dgbwiki.com/index.php?title=DigiShield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigiByte documentation</a>.
            <br><br>There can exist approximately 100,000,000,000 bunkercoins. Each subsequent block will grant a random amount of coins to encourage miners to continue to secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/lost encryption
            passwords/etc. The block rewards are fixed and halve every 100,000 blocks. Starting with the 600,000th block, a permanent reward of 10,000 Bunkercoin per block will be paid. To learn more about the current block reward schedule, check out <a href="//github.com/bunkercoin-project/bunkercoin#how-to-get-bunkercoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GitHub page</a>.
            <br><br>If you want to help the Bunkercoin project, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Start mining, preferably on a CPU or GPU (not on an ASIC to keep the network stable) so the blocks will keep flowing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Host a node, it's as simple as running the Bunkercoin client on your server or computer and opening port 14200 on your router!
            </li>
            <li>
